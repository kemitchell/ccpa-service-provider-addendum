**Provider** and **Customer** agree to add the following terms to their **Agreement**:

# Service Provider

Both sides agree to do their respective parts to comply with the California Consumer Privacy Act and its regulations, consistent with _Provider_'s role as a "service provider", and not as a "third party", under that law.

# Prohibitions

_Provider_ may not:

- sell personal information collected from consumers covered by the California Consumer Privacy Act that _Customer_ discloses to _Provider_

- retain, use, or disclose such information for any purpose other than for the specific purpose of performing the services specified in the contract, including retaining, using, or disclosing such information for a commercial purpose other than providing the services specified in the contract

- retain, use, or disclose such information outside of the direct business relationship between _Provider_ and _Customer_

# Certification

_Provider_ certifies that _Provider_ understands the restrictions in [Prohibitions](#prohibitions) and will comply with them.

# Minimization

Both sides agree to limit use of personal information covered by the California Consumer Privacy Act to that reasonably necessary and proportionate to achieve the purpose of the _Agreement_, consistent with the meaning of "business purpose" under that law.

# Subcontracting

_Provider_ agrees to ensure that each subcontractor that processes _Customer_ information covered by the California Consumer Privacy Act will also qualify as a "service provider", and not as a "third party", under that law.

# Conflicts

If the terms of this addendum conflict with terms of the _Agreement_, the terms of this agreement take precedence.
