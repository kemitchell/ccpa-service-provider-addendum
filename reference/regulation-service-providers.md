> ## Section 999.314.  Service Providers
>
> (a) To the extent that a person or entity provides services to a person or organization that is not a business, and would otherwise meet the requirements of a "service provider" under Civil Code section 1798.140(v), that person or entity shall be deemed a service provider for purposes of the CCPA and these regulations.
>
> (b) To the extent that a business directs a person or entity to collect personal information directly from a consumer on the business's behalf, and would otherwise meet all other requirements of a "service provider" under Civil Code section 1798.140(v), that person or entity shall be deemed a service provider for purposes of the CCPA and these regulations.
> 
> (c) A service provider shall not use personal information received either from a person or entity it services or from a consumer's direct interaction with the service provider for the purpose of providing services to another person or entity.  A service provider may, however, combine personal information received from one or more entities to which it is a service provider, on behalf of such businesses, to the extent necessary to detect data security incidents, or protect against fraudulent or illegal activity.
>
> (d) If a service provider receives a request to know or a request to delete from a consumer regarding personal information that the service provider collects, maintains, or sells on behalf of the business it services, and does not comply with the request, it shall explain the basis for the denial.  The service provider shall also inform the consumer that it should submit the request directly to the business on whose behalf the service provider processes the information and, when feasible, provide the consumer with contact information for that business.
>
> (e) A service provider that is a business shall comply with the CCPA and these regulations with regard to any personal information that it collects, maintains, or sells outside of its role as a service provider.
